"Welcome, Commander! Your mission is to defend the four fortress buildings against the advancing enemy. 
The enemy will only attack one of the two paths: 
- **Path 1:** Buildings 1 & 3 are located here.
- **Path 2:** Buildings 2 & 4 are located here.
Your goal is to strategically allocate your troops to these buildings to match or exceed the incoming enemy force on the chosen path.

### 🛡️ Building Types
Each building has a specific function:
1.  **Soldier Type:** Provides high defensive health points (HP) and high troop capacity.
2.  **Shooter Type:** Provides lower capacity but enhances the attack factor of your troops.

The number of enemy troops and the path they choose are **randomly determined** each turn. Analyze the situation, deploy your army, and repel the invasion!"
